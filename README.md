# Getting Started
Since this service is running in docker-compose containers, all you need in your machine is Docker and Git.
There are some useful dev commands in the Makefile. So you can run the project locally as it follows:

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:viniciuschan/farmland-api.git
```

2. To start the service using docker-compose run the following command:
```
make run
```

3. As soon as your containers are up, you must migrate the db structure:
```
make migrate
```

4. Now you check all project test cases by running:
```
make test
```

5. I prepared a sample of initial fixtures to populate the development db.
```
make load_fixtures
```

6. Now you can test the following endpoints, with the sample data I prepared
