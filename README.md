# Getting Started
Since this service is running in docker-compose containers, all you need in your machine is Docker and Git. There are some useful dev commands in the Makefile I prepared. So you can run the project locally as it follows:

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:viniciuschan/farmland-api.git
```

2. To start the service using docker-compose run the following command:
```
make run
```

3. As soon as your containers are up, you must migrate the db structure:
```
make migrate
```

4. Now you check all project test cases by running:
```
make test
```

5. I prepared a sample of initial fixtures to populate the development db.
```
make load_fixtures
```

6. Now you can test the following endpoints, with the sample data I prepared
